# Week.1 BLOG - 3D SCANNER

DATE: 2025-9-16 TO 2025-9-23

Description: Our aim is to set up a 3D model through using a mobile 3D scanner app (mobile is not necessary, but i only have mobile phone)

## IN CLASS (A TRY)

### TOOLS
- A 3D SCANNER
- A PHONE (ANDRIOD)
- A classmate

### Object
- a Water Bottle (transperant)?
- earpods?
- an Umbrella?
- a...

### STEPS
During class, we borrowed a 3D scanning device and controlled it using a mobile phone. While connecting the rotating turntable, we encountered an issue: we couldn't simultaneously control the rotation of the turntable and initiate the 3D scan. Eventually, we discovered that on the 3D scanning initiation interface, there was a floating window that could control the turntable's rotation. However, since I wasn't the one operating it at that moment, I couldn't take a screenshot to illustrate this.

### PROBLEMS
1. Transparent items can't be scan, because 3d scanner use X-ray or laser to scan, which would go directly through transparent item.

2. Earpods reflect light(laser?), can't be scanned.

3. the umbrella is too big to be scanned.

## AFTER CLASS

### OBJECT
- MR.HOLMES - （this character is directly derived from game "The Great Ace Attorney"）
- Game console protective case
- A PLASTIC ornaments (from game "Kirby")

### TOOLS
- an ipad
- app "reality scan"
- app "3d scanner"



### STEPS


  I downloaded many 3D scanning software, but only RealityScan could successfully scan and export models. The quality of 3DScanner isn't as good as RealityScan. RealityScan works by taking photos of a stationary object, analyzing the connections between the photos, and generating a 3D model. It has two modes: Augmented Reality Mode (without auto-masking) and Camera Control Mode (with auto-masking).

  Initially, I used the Camera Control Mode (auto-masking mode) to take photos around a Holmes doll. I turned on the burst mode, so it could automatically capture photos from all the necessary angles while I was holding the iPad and moving around the object, even at positions where it would be difficult for me to press the shutter button. It managed to reconstruct the top part of the doll but failed to capture the underside. I tried hanging it in the air for shooting, using my poster display stand along with its small hanging rope. However, due to the cluttered background, uneven lighting, and other issues I couldn't pinpoint, the result was unsatisfactory—far worse than when it was simply placed stationary on the table. This time, even the face of the Holmes doll wasn't properly generated.

  I suspect the plush material also posed its own challenges. I then switched to scanning a game package, and since its shape was simpler, the scanning result turned out much better than with the Holmes doll.

  I also noticed that the auto-masking mode often mistakes brightly colored objects as part of the main subject, when they should actually be removed. Photos with incorrect subject recognition can only be deleted, so even if I took 200 photos, only about 70 of them were actually usable.

  When using the non-auto-masking mode (Augmented Reality Mode), the environment can be properly identified, and during processing, I can select only the specific area I need. However, since the model of this package was intended for printing, I wanted a more complex shape. Therefore, I decided to scan a Kirby desk figurine instead. This time, I placed it on a table, enabled burst mode, and used the non-auto-masking mode while holding my iPad and moving around it to take photos. I made sure that about 80% of the photos turned green, indicating sufficient overlap and connection between them to generate a model.

  After taking all the photos, I clicked "Next.",the blue button in the bottom right corner. The photos were then uploaded to the cloud for processing. Once the processing was complete, the model was downloaded. After these three steps, I could finally see the generated model.

If you want to export your 3Dmodel, in the bottom there is two choice. One is "export 3D Model", click it, and you will have two file formats.

The second choice is to upload your model on Sketchfab, then you can go to the website and download it, more file formats.

Finally, we obtained our 3D model file, and imported it into Mixmesher. As for how to make the model surface smoother, this will be demonstrated in the explanation of week 2.

### REFLECTION
1. The fluffy, smooth and transparent material is not allowed.

2. sometimes, too small item also is hard to be scanned.

3. The core technology of Realityscan and 3Dscanner app is different. The former uses Photogrammetry, the latter uses LiDAR.

### OUTPUT

a plastic kabi toy
