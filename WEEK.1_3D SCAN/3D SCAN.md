### Week.1 BLOG - 3D SCANNER!!

DATE: 2025-9-16 TO 2025-9-23

Description: Our aim is to set up a 3D model through using a mobile 3D scanner app (mobile is not necessary, but i only have mobile phone))

## IN CLASS (A TRY)

**TOOLS**
- A 3D SCANNER
- A PHONE (ANDRIOD)
- A classmate

**Object**
- a Water Bottle (transperant)?
- earpods?
- an Umbrella?
- a...

**PROBLEMS!**
1. Transparent items can't be scan, because 3d scanner use X-ray or laser to scan, which would go directly through transparent item.

2. Earpods reflect light(laser?), can't be scanned.

3. the umbrella is too big to be scanned.

**FINALLY..**
I decided to use phone to scan after class.

## FORMAL WORK


**OBJECT**
MR.HOLMES - （this character is directly derived from game "The Great Ace Attorney"）

**TOOLS**
- an ipad
- app "reality scan"
- app "3d scanner"


**PROBLEMS!**
1. MR.HOLMES missed his bottom : I put Mr.Holmes on the table, thus no bottom pictures were taken.

2. The model is bad: Try to take more photos from different perspectives.
3. THe model combined different things (in pictures) to Mr.Holmes : try to use "mask"
