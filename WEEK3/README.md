## TASK
- design a kerf testing piece

## STEPS
1. find a reference from the Internet. (What a pity, we didn't notice what saverio sent in Wechat.)<br>

2. measure the thickness of our wooden board, it's 4mm.<br>

3. We decided to draw calibration ports with a range of 3.5–4.5 mm, with each port differing by 0.05 mm. The distance between two adjacent ports is 13 cm, resulting in a total of ten calibration ports. We used AutoCAD for drafting the dimensions, as this software provides precise numerical values and features a snap-to-grid function, ensuring accurate drawings. This was Wang’s first time using AutoCAD, while I had used it six months ago and guided her through the process.<br>

4. Then we have the file, get to the first（ground) floor to use lasercutter.We adjusted the parameters on the computer for laser cutting, with blue lines for engraving and black lines for cutting. We set the cutting speed and power according to the 4mm template specifications in the file. Next, we adjusted the focal length, closed the lid, ensured the ventilation fan was turned on, and began cutting. However, after the first attempt, the material was not fully cut through due to the excessive cutting speed. The engraving result, on the other hand, was excellent—even the very small text remained clearly visible.<br>

5. So we slowed down the laser cutting speed and cut it again, and it came out perfectly.We found that the 3.75 mm port could snugly hold the wooden board, indicating a cutting error of 0.125 mm for the 4 mm board. However, the instructor in charge mentioned that since the focal length is frequently adjusted, the error might vary each time and may not always be exactly 0.125 mm for 4 mm boards. We found this point reasonable.<br>

## IMAGE A FUTURE
**BASIC RULES**
- NO MASS
- NO GLUE<br>
**WHAT THE FUTURE WILL BE LIKE**<br>
  Initially, I conceived a sci-fi world based solely on the concepts of 'no mass' and 'no glue', developing the idea that mass production is not used due to resource scarcity, and everyone wants personalized products or promotes multi-purpose objects that can adapt to different people's needs. I provided personalized explanations for products like communication devices, water cups, chairs, etc. Then, Saverio told us that we need to first envision a future before thinking about products. Afterwards, from my own perspective, because I am sensitive to sound—when sleeping, there are people outside having parties, talking loudly, or car noises—so I need earplugs plus noise-canceling headphones. I imagined a future with severe noise pollution, where people need to wear earplugs that only accept specific frequency bands of sound, helping to block out noise.
