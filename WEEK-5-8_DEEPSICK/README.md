# MAKE A RESEARCH (BLOW MOLDING)
Our team has selected the blow molding process as the subject of our study. We briefly reviewed this section in our "bible" (Manufacturing Processes for Design Professionals). We used various search engines (including Bing and Xiaohongshu) to search for relevant information and found that, overall, there are three main processes: EBM, IBM, and ISBM. After discussing and studying together in the group and on Figma, we decided that each person would be responsible for explaining one part. The specific content can be found in the following PDF.

# IMAGINE A NEW WAY
Later, the professor asked us to assume that this process is carried out in a Fablab, focusing on low-tech, small-scale modifications. At the beginning, we considered alternative solutions for every step of the blow molding process, such as using gel instead of PET, or a hairdryer instead of high-pressure air. The picture shows our detailed divergent thinking.

The professor told us that changing everything might be a bit difficult, and we only need to change one step. Based on our ideas, he also suggested that PET bottles could be used as 3D printing filament. But since the surfaces of the bottles are uneven, they need to be flattened before proceeding to the next step. We can use the re-blow molding process to make their surfaces flat.The main goal was to remove the imprints on the surfaces of different bottles. At that time, our idea was to use hot air and molds, so that the PET bottles would be heated by the hot air and conform to the molds, making them smooth.

However, the problem is that this would require molds for different bottle sizes, and some bottles are quite large, which would consume excessive resources. We tried to see how other bloggers were doing it, and after searching online with relevant keywords, we found that simply applying heat evenly could smooth the bottle’s surface.

Thus, we came up with an idea for a simple device:

1. First, insert an inflation hole into the bottle cap to fill the bottle with air.

2. Fix the nozzle of the inflation hole to a rotating stand, and use a suction cup to fix the bottom of the bottle to the stand. Then, once activated, the stand will automatically rotate at a constant speed and move left and right. Under the rotating stand, the induction stove will heat the bottle, ensuring uniform heating across the entire bottle.

3. Once the bottle surface is smoothed out, turn off the induction stove, remove the bottle, and it is ready for use in 3D printing.

Here is our concept diagram.

We built it according to the concept diagram. Initially, we planned to make a rough model of a device with a base size of A3, but in this case, the paper cups used to support it couldn't hold the long rods, so we used shorter pipes instead, and the model was correspondingly smaller. We used straws to make the horizontal beams, splitting them into two sections, and found a plastic bottle with a pointed neck to simulate the connection between the nozzle and the horizontal beam. For the suction cup at the rear end, we used a bottle cap for illustration. We fixed the horizontal beams to the pillars with wire while ensuring they could rotate, and during the process, we also used twist ties and similar tools. Finally, we found an acrylic plate of a similar shape to represent the induction cooker, placing it between the bases of the pillars. However, we felt that with this setup, the induction cooker was too far from the bottle to heat it effectively, so we placed the acrylic plate on the base (even so, the size still deviated from what we had initially imagined).

We also made a poster for our design.
